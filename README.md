# Bank Marketing Data Set Example Project

## Description

This repository contains examples of various data science project components performed on a bank marketing data set contained on the UCI machine learning data repository.

## Purpose

This repository is a collection data science, analytics, and machine learning topics using a common example:

+ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
    + Visualization & Plotting Data
+ Data Preprocessing
+ Downsampling, Upsampling, and SMOTE
+ Classification of a binary target
  + Simple algorithms
  + Changes to threshold
+ Confusion Matrix

## Who will find this useful

+ Data Scientists, Machine Learning Engineers, students, & anybody that is just interested
+ Those interested in sampling techniques for classification
+ Those interested in different metrics used in clustering/segmentation
+ Those interested in the grid search cross validation approach to hyperparameter tuning
