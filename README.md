# Bank Marketing Data Set Example Project

## Descriptions
This repository contains an example done for the bank marketing data set contained on the UCI machine learning data repository.  There is only the Jupyter notebook contained, and the dataset can be found on the link below.  The work was completed on a Saturday & Sunday in March of 2020 with the intention that there was a harsh deadline approaching and the analyst wants to provide a thorough first-pass analysis.
## Purpose
This repository's purpose is to give a simple example of a data science/analytics project in notebooks that shows:
+ Data Acquisition
+ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
+ Visualization
+ Segmentation/Clustering
+ Downsampling
+ Classification of a binary target
+ Jaccard's metric in action
## Who will find this useful
+ Students/competitors tasked with answering questions from this datast
+ Those interested in different metrics used in clustering/segmentation
+ Those interested in the grid search cross validation approach to hyperparameter tuning
