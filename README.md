# Bank Marketing Data Set Example Project

## Description

This repository contains an example done for the bank marketing data set contained on the UCI machine learning data repository.  There is only the Jupyter notebook contained, and the dataset can be found on the link below.  The work was completed on a Saturday & Sunday in March of 2020 with the intention that there was a harsh deadline approaching and the analyst wants to provide a thorough first-pass analysis.

## Purpose

This repository is a collection data science, analytics, and machine learning topics using a common example:

+ Data Preprocessing
+ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
+ Visualization & Plotting Data
+ Segmentation/Clustering
+ Downsampling, Upsampling, and SMOTE
+ Classification of a binary target
  + Simple algorithms
  + Changes to threshold
+ Jaccard's metric
  + Hierarchical Clustering
  + Distance metric
+ Confusion Matrix

## Who will find this useful

+ Students/competitors/data science beginners
+ Those interested in different metrics used in clustering/segmentation
+ Those interested in the grid search cross validation approach to hyperparameter tuning
